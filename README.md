## How Mining Works Talk Demo

This talk is at this time mostly a demo about how mining works in the context of showing the steps to get from a centralized, very simple value transfer system, up to building a blockchain and everything in between.

It will be being updated and I will probably also add in a Golang version in the future.

### Many thanks to

Most of the concept and a lot of the code from this repo come from a wonderful talk and demo by Haseeb Qureshi.
